## Some observations:
# The Javascript file contains some data that isn't shown on the actual webpage, namely in the last 3 entries of each array.
# Furthermore, it appears as if not all entries in the Cookiebot table are actually true Cookies.
# The following types are listed:
# > HTTP: ID 1, most likely actual Cookies.
# > HTML: ID 2, no idea what this type is supposed to be.
# > Pixel: ID 5, Tracking pixels embedded on the website
# Additional information includes a regular expression (possibly to identify variations of the same cookie)
# and a final URL as the last entry, possibly the true destination where the data is sent to?
